# This workflow build and push a Docker container to Google Artifact Registry and deploy it on Cloud Run when a commit is pushed to the "main" branch
#
# Overview:
#
# 1. Authenticate to Google Cloud
# 2. Authenticate Docker to Artifact Registry
# 3. Build a docker container
# 4. Publish it to Google Artifact Registry
# 5. Deploy it to Cloud Run
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Ensure the required Google Cloud APIs are enabled:
#
#    Cloud Run            run.googleapis.com
#    Artifact Registry    artifactregistry.googleapis.com
#
# 2. Create and configure Workload Identity Federation for GitHub (https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setting-up-workload-identity-federation)
#
# 3. Ensure the required IAM permissions are granted
#
#    Cloud Run
#      roles/run.admin
#      roles/iam.serviceAccountUser     (to act as the Cloud Run runtime service account)
#
#    Artifact Registry
#      roles/artifactregistry.admin     (project or repository level)
#
#    NOTE: You should always follow the principle of least privilege when assigning IAM roles
#
# 4. Create GitHub secrets for WIF_PROVIDER and WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
#
# 5. Change the values for the GAR_LOCATION, SERVICE and REGION environment variables (below).
#
# NOTE: To use Google Container Registry instead, replace ${{ env.GAR_LOCATION }}-docker.pkg.dev with gcr.io
